LABELS is a list containing 9 columns that exist in df
df[LABELS] are calling 9 columns that are assigned as Labels in the exercise
Note: .astype() only works on a pandas Series. Since you are working with a pandas DataFrame, 
you'll need to use the .apply() method and provide a lambda function called categorize_label 
that applies .astype() to each column, x.

# Define the lambda function: categorize_label
categorize_label = lambda x: x.astype('category')

# Convert df[LABELS] to a categorical type
df[LABELS] = df[LABELS].apply(categorize_label, axis=0)

# Print the converted dtypes
print(df[LABELS].dtypes)
